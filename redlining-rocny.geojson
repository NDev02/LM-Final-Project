Those on the side streets are slightly smaller with properties not quite so extensive. The whole atmosphere denotes wealth with its wide and shaded streets. The primary drawbacks are an almost total lack of market plus very high taxes. Anyone who could afford homes of this character would now prefer to be further out despite the good transportation and all city facilities including schools, churches and nearby shopping centers. Because of this, future trend seems downward.","9":"East Avenue, Rochester Low 1st A-6 11/1/39","10":"","71":"9","72":"41.73, Effective Tax Rate for all \"A\" areas in ROchester based on 3 sales $50.49.","1a":"  Yes","1b":"Executives, white-collar & retired businessmen with incomes of $7500-50,000+","1c":"0 ","1d":"0","1e":"None","2a":"Large 1-family 3-4 stories, 12-20+ rooms ","2b":"Brick, stone & stucco ","2c":"Up to 40 years ","2d":"Excellent ","2e":"98% ","2f":"98% ","2g":"*17,500-60,000 ","2h":"*15,000-50,000 (-)16  ","2i":"1939 *12,500-40,000, *Nominal (-)19  ","2j":"None ","2k":"Downward ","2l":"No rentals ","2m":"No rentals -  ","2n":"1939 No rentals -  ","2o":"None for rent ","2p":" ","4a":"0","4b":"0","5a":"0","5b":"0"}}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"MultiPolygon","coordinates":[[[[-77.572217,43.136073],[-77.57195,43.137141],[-77.570277,43.137335],[-77.569745,43.137377],[-77.569117,43.137377],[-77.568851,43.137349],[-77.568262,43.138431],[-77.563869,43.138653],[-77.56328,43.141276],[-77.564345,43.141276],[-77.563299,43.143648],[-77.562881,43.144231],[-77.561435,43.144203],[-77.560542,43.144259],[-77.560104,43.144425],[-77.559154,43.14455],[-77.558089,43.144647],[-77.55729,43.144744],[-77.556359,43.144772],[-77.555218,43.144592],[-77.554362,43.144272],[-77.553602,43.144217],[-77.553278,43.143579],[-77.553449,43.136419],[-77.572217,43.136073]]]]},"properties":{"name":"Brightondale Rochester","holc_id":"A7","holc_grade":"A","area_description_data":{"0":"Rochester, New York","2":"100 ","3":"5 1-family at $6000-10,000 1/2 on order, 1/2 slow","5":"3","6":"Ample","8":"This neighborhood, on hillside land sloping southward, is not entirely homogenous except as to desirability.

The houses, which are quite dilapidated looking and rather unsightly, are set back just a little from the street. Lots are rather narrow. There are all city facilities and schools, churches and stores are nearby. It is not a slum district but has little to recommend it save convenience of location and good transportation so that its future is probably downward. It should be noted that Rundel Park is above the average.","9":"Rochester 4th D-4 11/1/39","10":"","71":"9","72":"41.73, Effective Tax Rate for all D areas in Rochester based on 158 sales $74.70","1a":" Slowly ","1b":"Low-grade laborers with incomes of $1000-$1800.
